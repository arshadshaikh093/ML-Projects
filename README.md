# ML-Projects
**Fraud Detection:** This project tries to identify if the transaction was a fraud on the Credit Card dataset. Since there were 27 fields and types of transacton, we tried to extract the top 10 significant fields and performed SVM model to classify the fraudulent activity. Top 10 fields are determined by sorting the correlation coefficients of all fields w.r.t to final activity. The model built was able to correctly identify frauds with an Accuracy of approx 93%


**Linear Regression:** This Project attempts to calculate the Flat cost based on single parameter (Simple Linear Regression) and multiple fields (Multi Linear Regression)
Depending upon Area of the flat, No. Of Beds and other parameters it attempts to predict the Flat cost


**SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes:** These classification algorithm exercises attempts to Classify the Surivival of a Passenger on Titanic Dataset. Further it tries to classify all other fields such as Ticket Class, Sex etc of the Passenger.


**Decision Tree:** Created a Decision Tree based model to process the Attrition, Bank Loan and Titanic Dataset
